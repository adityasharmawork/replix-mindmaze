# Replix - Mindmaze (Frontend)

This is a Vite + React frontend that displays competitive programming results fetched from a backend API.

## Quick start

1. Place your `replix_logo.png` in `public/` (already included if provided).
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

The app will open on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Notes
- The backend base URL is hard-coded in `src/utils/api.js`. Change if needed.
- Uses Tailwind for styles; adjust `tailwind.config.cjs` as desired.
